# 5-DoF Robotic Arm for Color-Based Sorting

![3D Visualization of the Robotic Arm](images/5DoF_Robotic_Arm.jpg)

This repository contains the documentation and my contributions to a collaborative group project for the "CT7158: Robotic Systems" module at London Metropolitan University. The project involved the complete design, 3D printing, assembly, and programming of a 5-degree-of-freedom robotic arm capable of sorting Skittles by color.

My primary contributions to this project included the **firmware development for the ESP32**, the **custom gripper design**, **servo motor testing**, and the **project documentation**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **5-DoF Articulation:** A custom-designed and 3D-printed robotic arm with five axes of movement for high maneuverability.
* **Automated Color Sorting:** Integrates a TCS34725 color sensor to detect the color of a Skittle and an automated system to sort it into the correct container.
* **Inverse & Forward Kinematics:** The firmware includes a custom implementation of the Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD) algorithm to calculate the required joint angles to reach a specific XYZ coordinate.
* **Web-Based Control & Visualization:** A real-time 3D visualization of the robotic arm, built with p5.js and hosted on an ESP32 web server, allows for remote monitoring and control.
* **G-Code Command Interface:** The arm can be controlled via G-Code commands sent through the web interface for precise, repeatable movements.

## üöÄ Core Competencies

* **Embedded Systems:** C++ programming for the ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
* **Robotics & Kinematics:** Implementation of Inverse Kinematics (IK) and Forward Kinematics (FK) for robotic manipulators.
* **Sensor & Actuator Integration:** Interfacing with servo motors (via PCA9685 driver), and I2C sensors (TCS34725).
* **Web Development & IoT:** Hosting a web server on an ESP32, serving HTML/JavaScript files from an SD card, and creating a real-time 3D visualization with p5.js (WebGL).
* **3D Design & Printing:** Designing and optimizing custom parts for the robotic arm and its peripherals using Autodesk Fusion 360.
